      "title": "Introduction: From AI Alchemy to Engineering",
      "content": "Current AI application development, especially Agent building, is often compared to a mysterious alchemy. Despite advanced technology, many AI Agents frequently fail in actual use, and the root cause is often not insufficient model capabilities, but the failure of context engineering."

      "title": "What is Context",
      "definition": "Essentially, context is the collection of all information provided to a large language model (LLM) for completing the next reasoning or generation task. It goes far beyond just chat history.",

      "goal": "Its working goal is to decide what information should be placed in the context window for any generation step of the large language model."
