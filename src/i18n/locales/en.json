    "title": "About Context Engineering",
    "introduction": {
      "title": "Our Mission",
      "content": "In this era of surging AI waves, we are working hard to transform AI application development from intuition and luck-dependent 'alchemy' into a testable, iterable, and optimizable 'engineering'. We believe that successful AI systems do not rely solely on powerful models, but on the sophisticated management and application of 'context' behind them."
    },
    "vision": {
      "title": "Our Vision",
      "content": "We envision a future where all AI applications possess excellent 'memory' and 'understanding' capabilities, no longer plagued by 'context rot' or information gaps, becoming truly powerful, intelligent, and trustworthy partners. We hope to become the cornerstone of building high-quality AI applications, making context engineering the core competitiveness of every AI-native company. We firmly believe that through rigorous engineering methods and pursuit of ultimate craftsmanship, we can usher in a new era of more efficient collaboration between AI and humans."

        "title": "Intelligent Context Persistence & Memory Management",
        "description": "We provide advanced tools and platforms to help your AI agents efficiently 'write' and persistently store intermediate thoughts, plans, temporary data, and user session summaries and key facts. Whether it's short-term working memory or long-term knowledge accumulation (such as vector databases and knowledge graphs), we ensure information can be retrieved on demand in the future."
      },
      "retrieval": {
        "title": "Advanced Context Retrieval & Intelligent Selection",
        "description": "We build AI-native retrieval infrastructure that transcends traditional keyword matching, combining vector search's semantic understanding, full-text search's keyword matching, and metadata filtering to achieve high-recall rough screening from massive information."
      },
      "optimization": {
        "title": "Context Optimization & Efficient Compression",
        "description": "We provide innovative methods to perform lossy or lossless 'compression' of information before it enters the context window, carrying the most core signals with fewer tokens. This includes automatic summarization, history pruning, and other strategies."
      },
      "architecture": {
        "title": "Multi-Agent Architectures & Context Isolation",
        "description": "We design and deploy multi-agent architectures that allow sub-agents to work in parallel within their respective domains, digest large amounts of raw information, and then submit only the most critical and refined insights to the main agent."
      },
      "evaluation": {
        "title": "Context Quality Evaluation & Generative Benchmarking",
        "description": "We provide 'generative benchmarking' tools that use large models to generate high-quality Q&A pairs from your private documents in reverse, building 'golden datasets' to help you quantitatively evaluate the performance improvement effects of different embedding models, retrieval strategies, or re-ranking steps."

      "title": "Introduction: From AI Alchemy to Engineering",
      "content": "Current AI application development, especially Agent building, is often compared to a mysterious alchemy. Despite advanced technology, many AI Agents frequently fail in actual use, and the root cause is often not insufficient model capabilities, but the failure of context engineering."
